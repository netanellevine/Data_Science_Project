# Intro To Data Science Final Project
This is the final project for the Intro to Data Science course.  
There are 4 parts to this project:  
  1) Probability questions.
  2) Programming assignments using basic data science python libraries.
  3) Classification model.
  4) Regression model.

For the Classification model we chose a data-set  that contains a samples of weather in Australia.   
The purpose of this model is to predict whether it will rain tomorrow.

For the Regression model we chose a data-set that contains samples of categories regarding to white wine quality.
